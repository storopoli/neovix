My Minimalist Neovim config.

IDEs to the depths of Hell!

## Versions

1. regular `nixvim` that will load all packages
1. lazy `nixvim` with `lazy.nvim` that will lazy-load the packages on-demand

## How to Use

Just run anywhere with Nix:

```bash
nix run github:storopoli/neovix

# or for the lazy.nvim version
nix run github:storopoli/neovix#lazynvim
```

Or clone the repo and run:

```bash
nix run .

# or for the lazy.nvim version
nix run .#lazynvim
```

Additionally, you can use it as a flake:

```nix
{
  # ...
  inputs.neovix = {
    url = "github:storopoli/neovix";
    inputs = {
      nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      flake-parts.follows = "flake-parts";
    };
  };

  outputs = inputs @ { self, ... }:
  {
    imports = [
      {
        nixpkgs.overlays = [
          # ...
          inputs.neovix.overlays.default
        ];
      }
    ];
  };

}
```

Then `neovix` will be available as `pkgs.neovix`;
and the `lazy.nvim`-enabled version will be available as `pkgs.lazynvim`.

## Local Configurations with `exrc`

Local settings can be configured by  creating a `.nvim.lua` file in the project's
root directory.
If neovim is launched in the same directory as `.nvim.lua`,
it will evaluate your user configuration first,
followed by the local configuration.

An example `.nvim.lua` might be as follows:

```lua
local nvim_lsp = require('lspconfig')

nvim_lsp.rust_analyzer.setup({
  root_dir = function()
    return vim.fn.getcwd()
  end
})
```

## Neovimer's Creed

This is my neovim config.
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My neovim config is my best friend.
It is my life.
I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my neovim config is useless.
Without my neovim config, I am useless.
I must edit my neovim config true.
I must code more efficiently than my enemy who is trying to outcode me.
I must outcode him before he outcodes me.
I will...

My neovim config and I know that what counts in coding is not the plugins we install,
the noise of our mechanical keyboards,
nor the smoke tests we run.
We know that it is the commits that count.
We will commit...

My neovim config is human, even as I, because it is my life.
Thus, I will learn it as a brother.
I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories,
its themes, and its plugins.
I will keep my neovim config clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.
We will become part of each other.
We will...

Before Git, I swear this creed.
My neovim config and I are the defenders of my codebase.
We are the masters of our enemy.
We are the saviors of my projects.

So be it, until victory is Open Source's and there is no enemy, but peace!
